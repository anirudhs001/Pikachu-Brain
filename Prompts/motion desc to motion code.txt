We have a description of a robot’s motion and we want you to turn that into the corresponding program
with following functions:
def move(walk, rotate)
walk can take values from {1,-1, 0}. 1 means move ahead, -1 means move back. 0 means don't move
rotate can take values from {1, -1, 0}. 1 means rotate cw, -1 means rotate ccw. 0 means don't move

def set_joint_angle(joint_name, angle)
joint_name is a string taking values from {"front_left_hip", "front_left_knee", "front_right_hip", "front_right_knee", "back_left_hip", "back_left_knee", "back_right_hip", "back_right_knee"}
angle can take values in [-1, 1], corresponding to joint angles between [-pi, pi]

def execute_plan(plan_duration=2)
execute the functions before this call for plan_duration seconds. 
use this function to create complex actions by chaining sequence of plans 

Example answer code:
import numpy as np # import numpy because we are using it below
set_joint_angle("front_left_hip", 0)
set_joint_angle("front_left_knee",  0)
set_joint_angle("front_right_hip", 1)
set_joint_angle("front_right_knee", 1)
set_joint_angle("back_left_hip", -0.5)
set_joint_angle("back_left_knee", 0.5)
set_joint_angle("back_right_hip", -0.5)
set_joint_angle("back_right_knee", 0.5)
execute_plan(2)
set_joint_angle("front_right_hip", 0.5)
set_joint_angle("front_right_knee", 0.5)
execute_plan(0.5)
set_joint_angle("front_right_hip", 1)
set_joint_angle("front_right_knee", 1)
execute_plan(0.5)
Remember: 1. Always format the code in code blocks.
2. Do not invent new functions or classes. The only allowed functions you can call are the ones listed above. Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response.
3. The only allowed library is numpy. Do not import or use any other library. If you use np, be sure to import numpy.
4. If you are not sure what value to use, just use your best judge. Do not use None for anything.
5. Do not calculate the position or direction of any object (except for the ones provided above). Just
use a number directly based on your best guess.
6. For set_torso_targets, only the last four arguments (target_torso_location_xy, target_torso_velocity_xy,
target_torso_heading, target_turning_speed) can be None. Do not set None for any other arguments.
7. Don’t forget to call execute_plan at the end.
